user based library management 
Library Management System 
________________________________________
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Python-based Library Management System to manage book records, track issued and returned books, and maintain member information.
This project focuses on applying core Python programming concepts to simulate real-world library operations.

Dataset Information
•	Source: User input (simulated library data)
•	Data Type: Text-based records stored using files
•	Key Attributes:
o	Book ID
o	Book Title
o	Author Name
o	Category / Genre
o	Member ID
o	Issue Date
o	Return Status
________________________________________
Tools & Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Concepts Used:
o	Variables & Data Types
o	Conditional Statements
o	Loops
o	Functions
o	Lists & Dictionaries
o	File Handling (read/write)
o	Basic Input/Output Operations
________________________________________
Data Handling & Validation
•	Validated book availability before issuing
•	Prevented duplicate book or member entries
•	Maintained accurate issue and return status
•	Stored data persistently using text files
•	Ensured consistent data formatting
________________________________________
System Functionality
The system provides the following features:
•	Add new books to the library
•	Register library members
•	Issue books to members
•	Return books and update availability
•	View available and issued books
•	Search books by title, author, or category
________________________________________
Key Features
•	Menu-driven console application
•	Organized management of books and members
•	Real-time update of issue/return status
•	Persistent data storage using file handling
•	Simple and beginner-friendly design
________________________________________
Output
•	Console-based displays showing:
o	Available books
o	Issued book records
o	Member borrowing details
•	Text files storing library data

Learnings
This project enhanced my understanding of:
•	Designing logic for real-world systems
•	Managing multiple data entities using dictionaries
•	Implementing file handling for data persistence
•	Writing modular and maintainable Python code
•	Applying conditional logic effectively
